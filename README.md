# JavaProject
Welcome!

We have developed a JAVA program which consists of 2 key features. The first one is that it takes an input from the user. This input decides whether the user wants to convert English/Albanian words or even a whole sentence into morse code and the contrary. To ensure and enhance the usability of the program, we have set limitations.

These limitations consist of Java Exceptions which prevent the user from entering invalid inputs and continue to ask for inputs until it receives a valid one. The second feature gives the user the possibilty to have a better understanding of the Morse Code Language by being able to translate both ways.

In this JAVA project, we have tried to utilize the knowledge gained during the recent lectures in Object Oriented Programming to give you a better understanding of how all of these subjects can work together.
Such subjects may be :
1. Hashmaps.
2. Methods.
3. Enhanced for-loops.
4. Exceptions.
5. String manipulation functions.
6. Libraries.

Although there are many different ways of building such a program, we have chosen this way since it seemed to be the most inclusive one.
